##javascript library for audio / image sync

Not operable right now, but in development. Feel free to contact me for contributing or helping.

By now, if you want to have a look, you can:
1. Create a "dependencies" folder at root of project, and import dependencies in it :
- jQuery : https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.js
2. Open Demo/demo.html in your browser
